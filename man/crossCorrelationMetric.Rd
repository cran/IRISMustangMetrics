\title{Correlation between channels}

\description{
The crossCorrelationMetric() function calculates the maximum absolute correlation (\code{polarity_check}) 
and lag at maximum correlation (\code{timing_drift}) associated with two streams of seismic data.
}

\usage{
crossCorrelationMetric(st1, st2, maxLagSecs=10, filter)
}

\arguments{
  \item{st1}{a \code{Stream} object containing a seismic signal}
  \item{st2}{a \code{Stream} object containing a seismic signal}
  \item{maxLagSecs}{maximum number of seconds of lag to use}
  \item{filter}{a \pkg{signal} package filter to be applied before cross-correlating, optional}
}

\details{
%% max preformatted length ---------------------------------------------------
Details of the algorithm are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item{Both signals are demeaned and detrended}
  \item{If one signal has a higher sampling rate, it is decimated to the lower sampling rate using an IIR filter if it is a multiple of the lower sample rate. See (\code{signal::decimate}).}
  \item{Both signals are filtered, by default with a Butterworth 2-pole low pass filter with a 0.1 Hz (10 second) corner frequency. See (\code{signal::filter}).}
  \item{Signals are cross-correlated using the \code{stats::ccf()} function.}
}

The maximum absolute correlation is saved as \code{polarity_check} while the lag at peak correlation is saved as \code{timing_drift}.

\bold{Note:} For cross-correlation, seismic signals must not have any gaps -- they must be contained in a single \code{Trace} object.
}

\value{
A list with one \code{GeneralValueMetric} object is returned.
The metric names is \code{polarity_check}.
